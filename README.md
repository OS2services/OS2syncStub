This repository contains a single Java 11, Spring Boot, application, that returns "stubbed" data in the same format as the
OS2sync service operation that looks up a list of users from STS Organisation belonging to OrgUnits with a DTR ID.

The purpose of this code is to allow for easy testing, without having access to STS Organisation.
